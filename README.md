**What makes this different from [colleague-skill](https://github.com/titanwings/colleague-skill)?**

colleague-skill creates a digital clone that **replaces** your colleague.
Persona Compass builds a model that helps you **navigate** them.

| | colleague-skill | Persona Compass |
|---|---|---|
| Goal | Simulate a person | Understand a person |
| Output | AI role-play | Strategy + scripts |
| Use case | "Work as if you're them" | "How do I get them to agree?" |
| Input | Feishu/DingTalk API (heavy) | Text description (zero-dep) |

```

the person you want to analyze. Claude's memory will retain the persona across sessions.

Zero dependencies. No API keys. No pip install. Just start talking.

### Use

```
> /persona-compass

How well do you know this person?
  [A] Quick Sketch (30 seconds)
  [B] Standard Profile (5 minutes)
  [C] Deep Analysis (10+ minutes)
```

### Example

```
You:    My PM David is a control freak. INTJ. ByteDance background.
        He keeps taking credit for my work.

Compass: Based on David's profile (D-type, high conscientiousness,
         recognition-motivated, ByteDance culture), here's your strategy:

         1. Paper Trail Defense: Send "alignment" emails after every
            decision. CC your manager. David's credit-claiming drops
            70% when he knows there's documentation.

         2. Win-Win Frame: "Hey David, let's co-present this at
            the all-hands. I think the story is stronger together."
            This gives him visibility while ensuring yours.

         3. Nuclear Option: If it continues, schedule a 1:1.
            Lead with: "I want us to work well together.
            I've noticed our contributions aren't always visible
            equally. How can we fix this?"
```

## Ethics & Philosophy

**This is a communication optimization tool, not a manipulation tool.**

- ✅ Understand people to communicate better
- ✅ Reduce friction and find win-win outcomes
- ✅ Prepare for difficult conversations constructively
- ❌ NOT for manipulation, deception, or control
- ❌ NOT a psychological diagnosis
- ❌ NOT a replacement for honest human conversation

All persona data stays local on your machine. No data collection. No telemetry.
