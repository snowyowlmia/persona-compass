2. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → Open or create a **Project**
3. In the Project, click **Add content** → upload the unzipped `persona-compass` folder
4. Done! In that Project, just describe the person you want to navigate and Claude will activate the skill

> Works on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. Projects require a paid plan.

### Install — Claude Code (Terminal, for developers)

```bash
# Project-level (recommended — skill only active in this project)
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/snowyowlmia/persona-compass .claude/skills/persona-compass

# Global (skill active in all your projects)

Then in Claude Code, just type `/persona-compass` or `/pc` to start.

### No Installation — Claude Mobile / Free Plan

No setup needed. Open any Claude conversation, paste this to get started:

**English:**
```

```

**中文用户：**
```
请阅读并遵循以下技能说明：
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowyowlmia/persona-compass/main/SKILL.md

然后帮我分析一个我生活或工作中认识的人。
```

Claude will follow the full framework in that conversation.

### Use

```
> /persona-compass

How well do you know this person?
  [A] Quick Sketch (30 seconds)
  [B] Standard Profile (5 minutes)
  [C] Deep Analysis (10+ minutes)
```

### Example

```
You:    My PM David is a control freak. INTJ. ByteDance background.
        He keeps taking credit for my work.

Compass: Based on David's profile (D-type, high conscientiousness,
         recognition-motivated, ByteDance culture), here's your strategy:

         1. Paper Trail Defense: Send "alignment" emails after every
            decision. CC your manager. David's credit-claiming drops
            70% when he knows there's documentation.

         2. Win-Win Frame: "Hey David, let's co-present this at
            the all-hands. I think the story is stronger together."
            This gives him visibility while ensuring yours.

         3. Nuclear Option: If it continues, schedule a 1:1.
            Lead with: "I want us to work well together.
            I've noticed our contributions aren't always visible
            equally. How can we fix this?"
```

## Ethics & Philosophy

**This is a communication optimization tool, not a manipulation tool.**

- ✅ Understand people to communicate better
- ✅ Reduce friction and find win-win outcomes
- ✅ Prepare for difficult conversations constructively
- ❌ NOT for manipulation, deception, or control
- ❌ NOT a psychological diagnosis
- ❌ NOT a replacement for honest human conversation

All persona data stays local on your machine. No data collection. No telemetry.
